The 21st century forks into abundance or collapse. Which one we get depends, more than on any other variable, on when fusion energy arrives.

We modeled it. 10,000 simulated paths for the global economy through 2100. The result: each year of delay in the 2030–2040 window costs ~$115–166 trillion in expected GDP. Fusion by 2030 → 87% probability of abundance. After 2045 → virtually zero.

The reason is simple: Climate change increasingly diverts economic output to basic necessities — food, water, cooling, disaster response — which eat away the very surplus funding the R&D that could stop it. A feedback loop with a deadline.

Fusion addresses this feedback loop in two ways. Not only it provides abundant energy increasing economic output, but it also enables solutions to the very problems that are draining that output:
• Direct air capture (only fusion can power it at scale)
• Desalination (decouples water from climate)
• Industrial decarbonization (closes the carbon loop)

A virtuous cycle, reversing the vicious one.

Thanks to those two compounding effects, the ROI on accelerating fusion is extraordinary. Even at an implausibly high 16% social discount rate, *a single year of acceleration* pays off humanity's *total historical spending on fusion*. No economist has ever seriously proposed a rate that high. By any standard measure, we are underinvesting by at least an order of magnitude, probably more. This finding is robust to greatly varying assumptions.

But the real bottleneck isn't money. Even more important than *how much* we invest is *where* and *how* — which technologies to prioritize, which dependencies to unblock, which claims to trust.

So we built a tool to help investors, policy-makers, and R&D leaders allocate capital to the projects and technologies that actually move the needle.

The GAIA Tech Tree is a neurosymbolic AI system that maps the full dependency graph of fusion and fission technologies, identifies cross-cutting opportunities invisible to siloed R&D planning, and simulates alternative investment strategies. It includes systematic, evidence-based fact-checking to separate real progress from hype — critical when billions ride on whether a milestone is real or promotional. Think of it as a shared operating picture for the globally distributed effort to realize abundant, clean energy.

Two papers out today with the full analysis and the framework:

📄 The GAIA Tech Tree: A Neurosymbolic AI Framework for Strategic Technological Decision-Making

The window is open. These tools can help us push through it.

The 21st century forks into abundance or collapse.

Which one depends — more than on any other variable — on when fusion energy arrives.

We modeled it. Here's what we found. 🧵

Each year of delay in the 2030–2040 window: ~$115–166 TRILLION in lost GDP.

Fusion by 2030 → 87% chance of abundance.
After 2045 → virtually zero.

The transition zone is ~15 years wide. We're inside it now.

The reason is simple: climate change increasingly diverts output to food, water, cooling, disaster response.

This eats away the surplus that funds R&D. The technologies that could stop the crisis are themselves victims of it.

A closing window.

Fusion doesn't just raise the energy surplus — it enables solutions to the very problems that are draining it:
• Direct air capture (only fusion can power it at scale)
• Desalination (decouples water from climate)
• Industrial decarbonization (closes the carbon loop)

A virtuous cycle, reversing the vicious one.

The 21st century forks into abundance or collapse. The #1 predictor? When fusion energy arrives.

Fusion by 2030: 87% chance of abundance.
After 2045: virtually zero.
Each year of delay: ~$115–166T in lost GDP.

We modeled it — and built an AI tool to help beat the deadline.
